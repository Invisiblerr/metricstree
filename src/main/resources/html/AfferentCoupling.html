<h3>Afferent Coupling (Ca)</h3>
<p>
    Afferent Coupling between packages (Ca) measures the total number of external classes coupled to
    classes of a package due to incoming coupling (coupling from classes external classes of the package,
    uses CBO definition of coupling). Each class counts only once. Zero if the package does not
    contain any classes or if external classes do not use the package's classes.

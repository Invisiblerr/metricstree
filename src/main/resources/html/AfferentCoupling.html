<h3>Afferent Coupling (Ca)</h3>
<p class="main">
    Afferent Coupling between packages (Ca) measures the total number of external classes coupled to
    classes of a package due to incoming coupling (coupling from classes external classes of the package,
    uses CBO definition of coupling). Each class counts only once. Zero if the package does not
    contain any classes or if external classes do not use the package's classes.

<p class="main">
    In the picture above it can be seen that class A has only 1 incoming dependency (from class X),
    that is why the value for metrics Ca equals 1.
    High values of metric Ca usually suggest high component stability. This is due to the fact that the class
    depends on many other classes. Therefore, it canâ€™t be modified significantly because, in this case,
    the probability of spreading such changes increases.

        preferred values for the metric Ca are in the range of 0 to 500.

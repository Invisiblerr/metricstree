<h3>Li-Henry Metrics Set</h3>
<p class="main">
    Li and Henry in 1993 have proposed several object-oriented software metrics and evaluated the relation
    between their metrics and the maintenance effort in two commercial systems [1].
    They classified three groups of object-oriented metrics in the object-oriented paradigm.
    First group contains all the metrics (WMC, DIT, NOC, RFC, LCOM) except CBO.
    Second group contains three additional metrics (MPC, DAC, NOM).
    Third group contains two size metrics (SIZE1, SIZE2).
    Objective of these metrics were defined to make the relation between different types of metrics.
    The following subset of metrics proposed by Li and Henry is implemented here:
</p>
<p class="values">
    1. Number Of Attributes And Methods
</p>
<p class="values">
    2. Number Of Methods
</p>
<p class="values">
    3. Message Passing Coupling
</p>
<p class="values">
    4. Data Abstraction Coupling
</p>

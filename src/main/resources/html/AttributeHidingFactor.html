<h3>Attribute Hiding Factor (AHF)</h3>
<p>
    AHF is defined as the ratio of the sum of the invisibilities of all
    attributes defined in all classes to the total number of attributes defined in
    the system under consideration.

    Included in the MOOD set of metrics proposed by Brito e Abreu F. and Carapuça R.

<h3>Software quality correlation</h3>
<p>
    AHF is a measure of the use of the information hiding concept supported by the encapsulation mechanism.
    Information hiding allows coping with complexity by turning complex components into black boxes.
    AHF should be used as much as possible. Ideally all attributes would be hidden, thus being only accessed by the
    corresponding class methods. Very low values of AHF should trigger the designers’ attention.
    In general, as AHF increases, the complexity of the program decreases.
</p>
<p>
    According to reported studies [1, 2, 3, 4] the minimum and maximum allowed values of this metric are 67.7% and 100.0% respectively.

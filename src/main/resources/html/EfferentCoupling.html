<h3>Efferent Coupling (Ce)</h3>
<p class="main">
    Efferent Coupling between packages (Ce) measures the total number of external classes coupled to classes
    of a package due to outgoing coupling (coupling to classes external classes of the package,
    uses CBO definition of coupling). Each class counts only once. Zero if the package does not
    contain any classes or if external classes are not used by the package's classes.

</p>
<p class="main">
    To calculate the value of Ce, we must count the amount of classes dependent on other packages inside
    the analyzed package. For example, Package_2 has two classes C and D (see figure above). First, define the
    sets of classes that depend on classes C and D. In this case, the sets are {A, B} and {B} respectively.
    Considering Package_2, the value of Ce is equal to 2. It means there are two classes inside Package_2,
    having external dependencies.

</p>
<p class="values">
preferred values for the metric Ce are in the range of 0 to 20, higher values cause problems with care and development of code.

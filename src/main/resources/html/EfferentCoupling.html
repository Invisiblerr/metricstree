<h3>Efferent Coupling (Ce)</h3>
<p>
    Efferent Coupling between packages (Ce) measures the total number of external classes coupled to classes
    of a package due to outgoing coupling (coupling to classes external classes of the package,
    uses Ce definition of coupling). Each class counts only once. Zero if the package does not
    contain any classes or if external classes are not used by the package's classes.

    In the picture above it can be seen that class A has outgoing dependencies to 3 other classes,
    that is why metric Ce for this class is 3.
    The high value of the metric Ce > 20 indicates instability of a package, change in any of the numerous
    external classes can cause the need for changes to the package. Preferred values for the metric
    Ce are in the range of 0 to 20, higher values cause problems with care and development of code.

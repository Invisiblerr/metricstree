<h3>Number Of Attributes And Methods (SIZE2)</h3>
<p>
    Number of Attributes and Methods simply counts the number of attributes and methods of a class.
    It is an object-oriented metric that can be applied to modular languages by considering the number of variables
    (globally visible in a module) and its number of functions and procedures.

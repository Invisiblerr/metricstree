<h3>McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity (CC)</h3>
<p class="main">
    McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity (CC) is a measure of the control structure complexity of software.
    It is the number of linearly independent paths and therefore, the minimum number of independent
    paths when executing the software.

                        Learning if a class is suitable for reuse depends
                        on the complexity of its interface. Systems with

                        How well a class can be integrated depends the

<h3>Access To Foreign Data (ATFD)</h3>
<p class="main">
    Access To Foreign Data (ATFD) represents the number of external
    classes from which a given class accesses attributes, directly or via accessor-methods.
    High values may suggest that the class breaks encapsulation by relying on the internal representation
    of the classes it uses instead of the services they provide.

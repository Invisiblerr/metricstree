<h3>Number Of Parameters To Method</h3>
<p class="main">
    This metric measures the number of parameters of a method or constructor. A method (or constructor) that uses
    a high number of formal parameters makes maintenance more difficult:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It is difficult to write a call to the method, because the programmer must know how to supply
        an appropriate value for each parameter.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is externally difficult to understand, because calls to the method are longer than a single line of code.
    </li>
    <li>
        It can be internally difficult to understand, because it has so many dependencies.
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="main">
    Robert C. Martin, in [1], writes (page 40):
</p>
<p class="values">
    The ideal number of arguments for a function is zero (niladic).
    Next comes one (monadic), followed closely by two (dyadic).
    Three arguments (triadic) should be avoided where possible.
    More than three (polyadic) requires very special justification - and then shouldn't be used anyway.
</p>
<p class="main">
    Restrict the number of formal parameters for a method, according to the reason for the high number:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Several of the parameters are logically related, but are passed into the method separately.
        The parameters that are logically related should be grouped together
        (see the 'Introduce Parameter Object' refactoring on pp. 238-242 of [2]).
    </li>
    <li>
        The method has too many responsibilities. It should be broken into multiple methods
        (see the 'Extract Method' refactoring on pp. 89-95 of [2]),
        and each new method should be passed a subset of the original parameters.
    </li>
    <li>
        The method has redundant parameters that are not used. The two main reasons for this are:
        (1) parameters were added for future extensibility but are never used;
        (2) the body of the method was changed so that it no longer uses certain parameters,
        but the method signature was not correspondingly updated. In both cases, the theoretically correct
        solution is to delete the unused parameters (see the 'Remove Parameter' refactoring on pp. 223-225 of [2]),
        although you must do this cautiously if the method is part of a published interface.
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="main">
    When a method is part of a published interface, one possible solution is to add a new, wrapper method to the
    interface that has a tidier signature. Alternatively, you can publish a new version of the interface that
    has a better design. Clearly, however, neither of these solutions is ideal, so you should take care to design
    interfaces the right way from the start.
    The practice of adding parameters for future extensibility is especially bad. It is confusing to other programmers,
    who are uncertain what values they should pass in for these unnecessary parameters,
    and it adds unused code that is potentially difficult to remove later.

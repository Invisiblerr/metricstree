<h3>Number of Children (NOC)</h3>
<p class="main">
    Calculates the total number of direct subclasses of given class.
    This metric measures how many sub-classes are going to inherit the methods of the parent class.
    The size of NOC approximately indicates the level of reuse in an application.
    If NOC grows it means reuse increases.
    On the other hand, as NOC increases, the amount of testing will also increase because more children in a class
    indicate more responsibility. So, NOC represents the effort required to test the class and reuse.</p>

                    Understanding a class is supported if it has a
                    high number of children. First numerous children
                    show directly a high re-use (re-usability) of the
                    class under concern. Further with numerous
                    children exist many examples on how to re-use the
                    class, which helps to understand weather a class
                    is suitable, and how it can be re-used for a
                    particular tasks.

                <dd>
                    Learning (acquiring and memorizing knowledge) how
                    to (re-)use a class by extending it is influenced
                    by the number of children the class under concern
                    has. A high number of children, that is many
                    re-using child classes, allows acquiring
                    versatile knowledge on how to re-use a particular
                    class in different situations. This supports
                    through redundancy memorizing the knowledge about
                    how to re-use a particular class.

                <dd>
                    Understanding if a class can be integrated and
                    controlled by software engineers/developers
                    depends on the number of children a class has. A
                    high number of children indicates that a
                    particular class is well integrated into an
                    existing software system. This means, that it is
                    suitable for several different tasks,
                    self-descriptive since there exist many examples
                    on its usage, having a higher error tolerance,
                    since it is involved each time one of its
                    children is tested.
                    <p>Operability increases with increasing NOC.</p>

                <dt><strong>Attractiveness for Reuse:</strong></dt>
                <dd>
                    A class having a higher number of children
                    appears more attractive to the software
                    engineer/developer. It is a eye-catcher in a
                    class diagram or other representations since it
                    stands out by having many children. Associated
                    assumptions could be, that the class is stable,
                    since it is tested each time a child is tested,
                    that is well documented and understood, since it
                    has been extended so often, that it is easier to
                    understand, since there are many examples of
                    usage, that it helps to understand the children,
                    if the parent class has been understood, that is
                    plays a central role in the design, since many
                    classes extend its functionality.

                    A class having a higher number of children has a
                    lower changeability. The effort spent on
                    modification, fault removal or environmental
                    change is increased, since many child classes are
                    extending its functionality, depending on the
                    parent class. The side effects of modifications
                    are harder to predict. Fault removal effects
                    child classes. The need for environmental change
                    has to consider the child classes.

                    A class having a higher number of children is
                    difficult to replace. The children are dependent
                    on it, by extending specific functionality and
                    can depend on certain functionality the parent
                    class provides. It is difficult to find another
                    class satisfying these specific needs, allowing
                    to replace the parent class.

                    A class having a higher number of children has a
                    high maturity. The frequency of failure by faults
                    is low, since the many faults have been
                    identified in the various ways the child classes
                    interact with the parents. The parent class is
                    heavily used, since it is used each time a child
                    class is used.

                <dd>
                    To analyze a class having a higher number of
                    children requires higher effort. Diagnosis of
                    deficiencies or causes of failures involves the
                    children of a parent class. They have access to
                    the functionality and data provided by a class
                    and have to be involved in the analysis.
                    Identifying parts in a parent class which need to
                    be modified requires the analysis of all child
                    classes, which are effected by the modification.
                    To analyze a class completely it is also
                    necessary to look at its children to be able to
                    have the complete picture.

                    A class having a higher number of children bears
                    a higher risk of unexpected effect of
                    modification. Child classes are re-using parent
                    classes in various ways. They are directly
                    effected by modifications making it difficult to
                    predict how stable a class or software product
                    would be after modification.

                    A class having a higher number of children

                    modified software. All depending child classes
                    need to be included in the tests as well, since
                    modifications in the parent class have direct
                    impact on the extending child classes. The amount
                    of designed and implemented autonomous test aid
                    functions and test complexity is increased.

                    environments. The children are dependent on it,
                    by extending specific functionality and can
                    depend on certain functionality the parent class
                    provides. Adapting the parent class to a new
                    environment, can make it unsuitable for the
                    children, requiring adaptation in them as well.

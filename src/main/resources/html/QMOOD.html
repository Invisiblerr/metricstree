<h3>QMOOD</h3>
<p class="main">
    QMOOD was proposed by Bansiya and Davis [1] to measure software quality aspects in object oriented projects.
    This model deﬁnes 11 object-oriented design properties and links them to an appropriate design metric.

    Then, it identiﬁes six qualities attributes based on the ISO 9126 and propose equations using the
    design properties to measure such qualities.

<p class="main">
    Primarily QMOOD model was designed for evaluation with C++/Visual C++ validation
     suite though it can be applied on any object oriented language based software. The interpretation of the metric
     basis proposed [2] was used to apply the QMOOD to the Java. Similar to [2], z-score values of metrics were used.

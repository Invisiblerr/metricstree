<h3>Lack of Cohesion of Methods (LCOM)</h3>
<p class="main">
    The Lack of Cohesion in Methods metric is a measure for the number of not connected method pairs in a class
    representing independent parts having no cohesion. It represents the difference between the number of method
    pairs not having instance variables in common, and the number of method pairs having common instance variables.

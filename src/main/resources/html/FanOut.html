<h3>Fan-Out</h3>
<p class="main">
    Fan-in and fan-out are the metrics used to measure structural complexity of a node and
    helps in defining maintainability. Both these measurements can be defined for procedure and files.
    For example, consider the following g graph with the modules as nodes and the links between them as edges.

<p class="main">
Fan-in of a particular module represents the total number of modules dependent on it.
Fan-out of a particular module represents the number of modules this module depends on.
In the above graph, module-D has a fan-in of 3 links and fan-out of 2 links.
When a module has higher fan-in, it represents a better design structure that is that module has been
used more number of times, hence it can be a used for re-usability and reduces code redundancy.
Fan-out represents coupling among different modules. Higher fan out indicates a module is highly coupled.
Maintainability increases with the higher the fan-out.

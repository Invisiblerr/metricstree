<h3>Afferent Coupling (Ca)</h3>
<p class="main">
    Afferent Coupling between packages (Ca) measures the total number of external classes coupled to
    classes of a package due to incoming coupling (coupling from classes external classes of the package,
    uses CBO definition of coupling). Each class counts only once. Zero if the package does not
    contain any classes or if external classes do not use the package's classes.

<p class="main">
    In order to calculate the value of Ca for Package_1 (see figure above), we should count the number of classes
    out of the package that have dependencies incident on it. For example, the package Package_1 has classes
    called A and B. The sets that define the classes dependent on A and B are {C, E, F} and {C, D}, respectively.
    The union of these two sets is the set of classes that depend upon Package_1.
    In this case, the union set is given by {C, D, E, F}. Therefore, we conclude the Ca value for Package_1
    is equal to 4, the total elements in this union set {C, D, E, F}.
    It is noteworthy that class C has more than one dependency relationship focusing on Package_1,
    as seen in the two dependency sets. However, we count all dependencies only once, even a class that
    has more than one incident dependency relationship on the same package, like in the case of class C. Similarly,
    the counting procedure is applied for the remaining packages, resulting in zero for Package_2 and Package_3.

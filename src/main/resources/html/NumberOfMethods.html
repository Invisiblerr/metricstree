<h3>Number Of Methods (NOM)</h3>
<p class="main">
    Number Of Methods NOM(C) is defined as the number of local methods in a class C.
    NOM measures the number of methods locally declared in a class.
    Inherited methods are not considered. It is the size of the interface of a class and
    allows conclusions on its complexity.

                    Understanding if a class is suitable for reuse depends on its size.

                    Learning if a class is suitable for reuse depends
                    on the size and complexity of its interface. NOM
                    measures interface size.

                    How well a class can be integrated depends the
                    complexity of its interface. NOM measures
                    interface size.

                    Attractiveness of a class depends on the size of

                    The effort and time for diagnosis of deficiencies
                    or causes of failures in software entity, or for
                    identification of parts to be modified is
                    directly related to its size.

                <dd>
                    Changing a class requires prior understanding,
                    which, in turn, is more complicated for large
                    systems.

                <dd>
                    Complete testing requires coverage of all
                    execution paths. The number of possible execution
                    paths of a system increases with its size.

                    As for changeability,
                    the size of software has a direct impact. Each
                    modification requires understanding which is more
                    complicated for large systems.

                    The substitute of a component must imitate its

                    check for substitutability and to actually
                    substitute. Interface size is specifically
                    assessed by NOM.

<h3>Project/Package Non-Commenting Source Statements (PNCSS)</h3>
<p class="main">
    Summarizes Non Commenting Source Statements (NCSS) metric values for all classes in project/package (exclude test scope).
    The NCSS is calculated by counting the source lines which are not comments, nearly equivalent to counting
    the semicolons and opening curly braces. Comments and empty statements are ignored.

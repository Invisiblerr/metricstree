<h3>Loop Nesting Depth</h3>
<p>
    This metric measures the maximum nesting depth of loop statements.
    When statements are nested too deeply in the code they become difficult to understand.
    This is because understanding a line that is deeply nested requires an understanding of the context of that line.
    A method that contains a high level of nesting can be very difficult to understand.
    <br/>
    Besides the value of this metric can be helpful to estimate time complexity of given method.

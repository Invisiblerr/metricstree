<h3>MOOD</h3>
<p class="main">
    The MOOD metric set [1] is used to measure the properties of the system in which the design of the system is
    according to the concepts of Object-Oriented Design that is Encapsulation,
    Coupling, Inheritance, Information Hiding, Polymorphism.
    The set contains six main metrics to measure the design of the system.
</p>
<p class="values">
    1.  Method Hiding Factor(MHF)  and Attribute Hiding  Factor(AHF)
</p>
<p class="main">
    To measure how the attributes and methods of one class are encapsulated,
    Method and Attribute hiding factors are being used. MHF and AHF show the average amount of how the members of a
    class are hidden in the system. MHF and AHF are 100% of all the members hid, nut in the real world it
    is next to impossible because a class should communicate with other classes to provide different
    functionality of the system. It is not possible if the members are hidden Generally hiding the
    increase in the following order. Public, Protected Friend, Friend, Protected Friend.
    If we have low MHF, then the methods are visible to almost every class.
    The methods are unprotected and can be subjected to changes by any class.
    The methods have a high tendency of reusability. In another case, if we have high MHF,
    then methods are not visible to many class and they can not understand the working of it.
    These methods can be used only by the class containing it and it has less tendency of reusability.
</p>
<p class="values">
    2. Method Inheritance Factor  (MIF) and Attribute Inheritance Factor(AIF)
</p>
<p class="main">
    In Inheritance, the child or subclass inherits the properties (Attribute and Methods) of
    the parent or superclass. The extent to which these methods and attributes are inherited is defined by
    Method Inheritance Factor(MIF) and Attribute Inheritance Factor(AIF).
    A child class that inherits a large number of methods and attributes from its parent class contains a
    large value of MIF and AIF. As anything in a very small amount of very high amounts is harmful, the same case
    is with MIF and AIF. These values should be in a reasonable range.
    The low value of AHF shows that class should not inherit the attributes but rather the attributes
    should be private to the class. The child class can make some changes (override)  in the inherited methods.
</p>
<p class="values">
    3.  Polymorphism Factor (PF / POF)
</p>
<p class="main">
    To measure the degree or extent of method overriding by the child class form the parent or superclass,
    Polymorphism Factor (PF) is used. In polymorphism, the child class can implement the method in a different way.
    The same method can be implemented in different ways in the child and parent class. It is defined by the ratio
    of an actual number of method overrides and the maximum number of total method overrides.
    To keep the code clean and clear and provide high quality we can use high PF but it increases the complexity
    of the system. Polymorphism factor is associated with method overriding, it is not associated with method
    overloading.
</p>
<p class="values">
    4. Coupling Factor (CF / COF)
</p>
<p class="main">
    If two or more clauses are related to each other by means of inheritance or aggregation or association then,
    in that case, these classes are said to be coupled. Many functionalities of the system can be done with the
    help of coupled classes. It is not advisable to have too many independent classes. The high value of Cf
    shows that the classes of the system are more inter-connected and inter-dependent. This leads to the problem that
    sometimes it is very hard to change or repair the system in case of any bugs or problem because the
    functionality in which the bug is, could be implemented by more than two classes and we have to make changes
    in all the related classes.
    To measure the actual coupling between different classes Coupling Factor (CF) is used.
    It is the ratio of Actual coupling between different classes and maximum possible coupling can happen
    in the system. If a class can access the method and attributes of the second class then it is said that the
    first class is coupled with the second class. Generally, coupling happening due to inheritance is not
    considered while calculating the CF. The high value of coupling in the system leads to larger complexity.
    So it is advisable to have a high value of cohesion and low value of coupling. Good design architecture should
    contain less amount of coupling.

<h3>Polymorphism Factor (PF)</h3>
<p>
    The Polymorphism Factor is defined as the quotient between the actual number of different possible polymorphic
    situations, and the maximum number of possible distinct polymorphic situations for given class.
</p>
<p>
    Included in the MOOD set of metrics proposed by Brito e Abreu F. and Carapuça R.

<h3>Software quality correlation</h3>
<p>
    Polymorphism means having the ability to take several forms. In OO systems, polymorphism allows the
    implementation of a given operation to be dependent on the object that "contains" the operation.
    The POF numerator represents the actual number of possible different polymorphic situations.
    A given message sent to class Ci can be bound, statistically or dynamically, to a named method implementation
    which may have as many shapes as the number of times this same method is overridden (in Ci descendants).
    Polymorphism arises from inheritance. Binding (usually at run time) a common message call to one of several
    classes (in the same hierarchy) is supposed to reduce complexity and to allow refinement of the class hierarchy
    without side effects. On the other hand, to debug such a hierarchy, by tracing the control flow, this same
    polymorphism would make the job harder. Therefore, polymorphism ought to be bounded within a certain range.

<p>
    According to reported studies [1, 2, 3, 4] the minimum and maximum allowed values of this metric are 1.7% and 15.1% respectively.

<h3>Weighted Method Count (Weighted Method per Class) (WMC)</h3>
<p>A weighted sum of methods implemented within a class. It
    is parameterized by a way to compute the weight of each
    method. Possible weight metrics are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity</li>
    <li>Lines of Code</li>
    <li>1 (unweighted WMC).</li>
</ul>
<p>Submitted realisation uses McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity to obtain Weighted Method Count value.</p>

                        How well a class can be integrated depends on the

                        directly related to the size and complexity of

                    <dd>
                        Changing a class requires prior understanding,
                        which, in turn, is more complicated for large and
                        complex systems. Depending on the weight metric,
                        WMC allows an assessment of size or complexity.

                        Complete testing requires coverage of all

                        paths of a class increases with the number of
                        methods and their control flow complexity.
                        Depending on the weight metric, WMC allows an

                        As for changeability,
                        the size of software has a direct impact. Each

                        complicated for large systems. Size is
                        specifically assessed by the weighted versions of
                        WMC.

                        <p>Adaptability declines with increasing

<h3>Normalized Distance From Main Sequence (D)</h3>
<p class="main">
    This metric is used to measure the balance between stability and abstractness and is
    calculated using the following formula: D = |A + I - 1|, where A - abstractness, I – instability.
    The value of metric D may be interpreted in the following way: if we put a given class on a graph of
    the main sequence (see picture below) its distance from the main sequence will be proportional to
    the value of D.

<p class="main">
The value of the metric D should be as low as possible so that the components were located close
to the main sequence. In addition, the two extremely unfavourable cases are considered:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A = 0 and I = 0, a package is extremely stable and concrete,
        the situation is undesirable because the package is very stiff
        and can’t be extended;
    </li>
    <li>
        A = 1 and I = 1, rather impossible situation because a completely
        abstract package must have some connection to the outside, so that
        the instance that implements the functionality defined in abstract
        classes contained in this package could be created.
    </li>
</ul>

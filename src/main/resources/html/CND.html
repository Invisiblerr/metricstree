<h3>Condition Nesting Depth</h3>
<p class="main">
    This metric measures the maximum nesting depth of condition statements.
    When statements are nested too deeply in the code they become difficult to understand.
    This is because understanding a line that is deeply nested requires an understanding of the context of that line.
    A method that contains a high level of nesting can be very difficult to understand.
    As noted in

<p class="main">
    the human brain cannot easily handle more than three levels of nested if statements.

<h3>Abstractness (A)</h3>
<p>
    This metric is used to measure the degree of abstraction of the package and is somewhat
    similar to the instability. Regarding the definition, abstractness is the number of abstract
    classes in the package to the number of all classes.
    Preferred values for the metric A should take extreme values close to 0 or 1. Packages
    that are stable (metric I close to 0), which means they are dependent at a very low level on other packages,
    should also be abstract (metric A close to 1). In turn, the very unstable packages (metric I close to 1)
    should consist of concrete classes (A metric close to 0).
    Additionally, it is worth mentioning that combining abstractness and stability enabled
    Martin to formulate thesis about the existence of main sequence (see picture below).

In the optimal case, the instability of the class is compensated by its abstractness, there is an
equation I + A = 1. Classes that were well designed should group themselves around this graph
end points along the main sequence.

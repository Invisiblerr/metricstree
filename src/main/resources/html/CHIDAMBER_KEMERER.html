<h3>Chidamber-Kemerer Metrics Set</h3>
<p class="main">
    In 1991, Chidamber and Kemerer proposed a first version of set of metrics and later the
    definition of some of them were improved and presented in 1994 [1].
    The Chidamber & Kemerer metrics set consists
    of 6 metrics calculated for each class: WMC, DIT, NOC, CBO, RFC and LCOM.
</p>
<p class="main">
    Objective of CK metrics were defined to measure design complexity in relation to their impact on
    external quality attributes such as
    maintainability, reusability, etc.

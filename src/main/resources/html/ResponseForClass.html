<h3>Response for a Class (RFC)</h3>
<p>The Response for Class (RFC) metric is the total number of methods that can potentially be
    executed in response to a message received by an object of a class.
    This number is the sum of the methods of the class, and all distinct methods are invoked directly within the class methods.
    Additionally, inherited methods are counted, but overridden methods are not,
    because only one method of a particular signature will always be available to an object of a given class.</p>

                Understanding if a class is suitable for reuse
                depends on its complexity and size of the method
                set it is related to.

            <dd>
                Attractiveness of a class depends on the
                complexity of the potentially reused code.
                Response For a Class allows an assessment of
                complexity.

                The effort and time for diagnosis of deficiencies
                or causes of failures, or for identification of
                parts to be modified is directly related to the
                number of executed methods in response to a
                message.

            <dd>
                Each modification must be correct for all
                execution paths. The size of the response set for
                a class (RFC) gives an idea about how many
                methods are potentially contributing to the size
                of the execution paths.

            <dt><strong>Testability</strong></dt>
            <dd>
                Complete testing requires coverage of all
                execution paths. Response For a Class computes
                the number of methods (directly) involved in
                handling a particular message.

                As for changeability,
                the complexity the control structure of software
                has a direct impact. Each modification must be
                correct for all execution paths. The size of the
                response set for a class (RFC) gives an idea
                about how many methods are potentially

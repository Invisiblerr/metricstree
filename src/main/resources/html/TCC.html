<h3>Tight Class Cohesion (TCC)</h3>
<p class="main">
    The Tight Class Cohesion metric measures the cohesion between the public methods of a class.
    That is the relative number of method pairs of a class that access in common at least one attribute
    of the measured class.
    Classes having a low cohesion indicate errors in the design.

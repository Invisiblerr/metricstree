<h3>Method Inheritance Factor (MIF)</h3>
<p class="main">
    The Method Inheritance Factor is defined as a quotient between the sum of inherited methods in all classes
    of the system under consideration and the total number of available methods (locally defined and include
    those inherited) for all classes.
</p>
<p class="main">
    Included in the MOOD set of metrics proposed by Brito e Abreu F. and Carapuça R.

<h3>Software quality correlation</h3>
<p class="main">
    At first sight, we might be tempted to think that inheritance should be used extensively.
    However, the composition of several inheritance relations builds a directed acyclic graph
    (inheritance hierarchy tree), whose depth and width make understandability and testability fade away quickly.
</p>
<p class="values">
    According to reported studies [1, 2, 3, 4] the minimum and maximum allowed values of this metric are 60.9% and 84.4% respectively.

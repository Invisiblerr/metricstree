<h3>Coupling Factor (CF)</h3>
<p>
    Coupling Factor (CF) measures the coupling between classes excluding coupling due to inheritance.
    It is the ratio between the number of actually coupled pairs of classes in a scope (e.g., package)
    and the possible number of coupled pairs of classes.

<h3>Software quality correlation</h3>
<p>
The client-supplier relation, represented by Cc ⇒ Cs , means that Cc (client class)
contains at least one non- inheritance reference to a feature (method or attribute) of class Cs (supplier class).
The CF numerator represents the actual number of coupling not imputable to inheritance.
It is desirable that classes communicate with as few other classes as possible, and that they exchange as
little information as possible. Coupling relations increase complexity, reduce encapsulation and potential reuse,
and limit understandability and maintainability. Also, coupling in software systems has a strong negative impact on
software quality, and therefore should be kept to the minimum during the design phase. However, for a given application,
classes must cooperate to deliver some kind of functionality. Therefore, CF is expected to be lower bounded.

    According to reported studies [1, 2, 3, 4] the minimum and maximum allowed values of this metric are 0% and 24.3% respectively.

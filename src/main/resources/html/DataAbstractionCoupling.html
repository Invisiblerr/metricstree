<h3>Data Abstraction Coupling (DAC)</h3>
<p class="main">
    Data Abstraction Coupling DAC(C) is defined as the number of attributes in a class C that have another
    class as their type.
    The DAC measures the coupling complexity caused by Abstract Data Types (ADTs).
    This metric is concerned with the coupling between classes representing a major aspect of the object
    oriented design, since the reuse degree, the maintenance and testing effort for a class are decisively
    influenced by the coupling level between classes.

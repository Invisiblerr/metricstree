<h3>Non-Commenting Source Statements (NCSS)</h3>
<p class="main">
    Determines complexity of classes by counting the Non Commenting Source Statements.
    The NCSS is calculated by counting the source lines which are not comments, nearly equivalent to counting
    the semicolons and opening curly braces. Comments and empty statements are ignored.
    Too large classes are hard to read and costly to maintain. A large NCSS number often means that a class
    has too many responsibilities and/or functionalities which should be decomposed into smaller units.

<p class="main">
    Described and implemented by Chr. Clemens Lee in JavaNCSS-Tool.

<p class="values">
    The regular value of NCSS metric is less than 1000 by default.

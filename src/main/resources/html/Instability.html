<h3>Instability (I)</h3>
<p>
    Instability between packages (I) measures the ratio between the outgoing and the total number of
    in- and outgoing couplings from classes inside the package from/to classes outside the package
    (coupling to classes external classes of the package, uses I definition of coupling).
    Each class counts only once. Zero if the package does not contain any classes or if external
    classes are not used by the package's classes.

In the picture above it can be seen that class A has 3 outgoing and 1 incoming dependencies,
therefore according to the formula value of metric I will equal 0,75.
On the basis of value of metric I we can distinguish two types of components:
<ul>
    <li>
        The ones having many outgoing dependencies and not many of incoming ones (value I is close to 1),
        which are rather unstable due to the possibility of easy changes to these packages;
    </li>
    <li>
        The ones having many incoming dependencies and not many of outgoing ones (value I is close to 0),
        therefore they are rather more difficult in modifying due to their greater responsibility.
    </li>
</ul>
Preferred values for the metric I should fall within the ranges of 0 to 0.3 or 0.7 to 1.
Packages should be very stable or unstable, therefore we should avoid packages of intermediate stability.

# MetricsTree IntelliJ IDEA plugin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/b333vv/metricstree.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/b333vv)

MetricsTree is an IDE extension that helps you evaluate quantitative properties of java code. 
MetricsTree calculates metrics on project, package, class and method levels. 
It supports the most common metric sets.
# Metrics
1. Project level - MOOD metrics set [1]:  
    - MHF: Method Hiding Factor
    - AHF: Attribute Hiding Factor
    - MIF: Method Inheritance Factor
    - AIF: Attribute Inheritance Factor
    - PF: Polymorphism Factor
    - CF: Coupling Factor
2. Package level - Robert C. Martin metrics set [2, 3]:
    - Ce: Efferent Coupling
    - Ca: Afferent Coupling
    - I: Instability
    - A: Abstractness
    - D: Normalized Distance from Main Sequence
3. Class level
    - Chidamber-Kemerer metrics set [4]:
        - WMC: Weighted methods per class
        - DIT: Depth of Inheritance Tree
        - NOC: Number of Children
        - CBO: Coupling between object classes
        - RFC: Response for a Class
        - LCOM: Lack of cohesion in methods
    - Lorenz-Kidd metrics set [5]:
        - NOA: Number of Attributes
        - NOO: Number of Operations
        - NOAM: Number of Added Methods
        - NOOM: Number of Overridden Methods
    - Li-Henry metrics set [6]:
        - SIZE2: Number of Attributes and Methods
        - MPC: Message Passing Coupling
        - DAC: Data Abstraction Coupling
        - NOM: Number of Methods
4. Method level:
    - LOC: Lines Of Code
    - CC: McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity
    - Loop Nesting Depth
    - Condition Nesting Depth
    - Number Of Loops

# Featutes   
 - Represents metrics calculation results as a tree view
 - Builds trees with metrics for class open in the editor or for the entire project
 - Supports controlling calculated metrics values
